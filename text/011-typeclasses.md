- Title: Typeclasses, proof-search

- Drivers: Matthieu Sozeau, Cyril Cohen

- Status: Draft

----

# Summary

- Generalize Equivalent keys
- Namespaces / levels of abstraction: control unfolding. CEP #5
- Configurability of the pattern-matching, unification and refinement
  tactic, transparency information (based on namespaces).
  
  Idea: Hint Resolve foo | priority pattern, using syntactic
  pattern-matching and full conversion...

- Trace: see Ltac 2.0
- MÃ©moisation: Ltac 2.0 too?

- Controlling shelving behaviors.

- Recognizing holes: 
  * typeclass to be solved
  * subgoal
  * implicit to be filled by unification
  
  Naming and refering to those.
